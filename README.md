## About

This is the `capstone` project for 2nd Quarter of the Fullstack Web development course at Kenzie Academy Brasil (Curitiba).
This quarter we closed the first half of the course, focused in the front-end with JS and React, working with Trello and Figma in a SCRUM methodology for about two weeks.

Our project aims to develop the basic MVP for a barter app where people could:
 
 - sign in and fill a profile
 - offer products
 - search products
 - put products in a `trading` cart
 - send and receive messages form people interested in their products
